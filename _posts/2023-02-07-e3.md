#### Exercise 2: Package For?
Together with a partner, choose an item that you would consider the “Nicest Thing to Hold” and create a name, dieline for a container, visual design for the package, and package prototype. The name can be the literal name of the object or something new you come up with. The outside of the package should be designed and a prototype package constructed. The prototype can be to scale if the item you chose is too large.

I will judge all the submissions and two prizes will be awarded. One prize for the nicest thing to hold and one prize for the best visual design.

##### Things to Keep in Mind
* Prototypes are not final, perfect things, they just need to show the idea
* Consider how the dieline folds when designing
* There is no required information on the package other than the name but that doesn’t mean there cannot be other information

##### Objectives
* Craft skills – cutting, folding, taping, gluing
* 3-D prototyping
* Beginning to consider branding as it relates to package design
* Relationship building

##### Requirements
* Physical package prototype
* Printed dieline with design in color on a tabloid sheet of paper (scaled to fit if necessary)
* Name of object on package
* Image(s) of prototype and pdf of dieline with design uploaded to blackboard added to miro
